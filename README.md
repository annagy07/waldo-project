# Prickly Waldo

## Description

_Prickly Waldo_ is a fun, interactive game for two players, inspired by the classic game "Where's Waldo?". In this version, players are tasked with finding not Waldo, but a well-hidden hedgehog named Prickly Waldo. Each player takes turns to locate Prickly Waldo as quickly as possible within a variety of images. The game spans 4 rounds, and each player's time is recorded â€” the player who spots Prickly Waldo fastest wins!

## Game Logic

- The game consists of **4 rounds**.
- In each round, both players (one after another) have the chance to find Prickly Waldo in an image.
- Each player has their own timer, which stops when they click on Prickly Waldo.
- The timer pauses for the inactive player and resumes from where it left off when it's their turn again.
- After 4 rounds, the player with the lowest overall time is declared the winner.

## JavaScript Overview

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript and consists of a `Game` class with the following structure:

- **Constructor**: Sets up initial game state, including the screens (start, pre-game, game, and end), players, search images, and rounds.
- **UI Setup**: Initializes event listeners for player name changes, game start, game play, and restart actions.
- **Timer Functions**: Contains methods to start and stop the timers, and update the timer display on the screen.
- **Game Flow**:
  - Methods to handle the pre-start screen, start a new round, and configure the game image.
  - Methods to position Prickly Waldo randomly, handle the event of finding Waldo, switch turns between players, and handle the transition to the next round or end the game.
- **End Game**: Display the results and the winning player.

The script is set to initialize the `Game` instance once the window loads.
